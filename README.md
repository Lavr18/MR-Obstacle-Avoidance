# MR-Obstacle-Avoidance
The fuzzy-logic based controller for the Mobile Robot to avoid obstacles based on the data from its sonar sensors.

The controller takes 3 inputs from sonar sensors called inputLEFT, inputFRONT, and inputRIGHT. InputFRONT is the minimum between the two front sensors.

The memebrship function for each input is as follows. X axis represents the distance to an obstacle in mm.
